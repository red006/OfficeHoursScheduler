# Office Hours

This is a project that will allow students to easily schedule office hours meetings with their teachers, and will allow teachers an easy resource to post their office hour times, schedule time blocks with students, and easily report cancellation of office hours and communicate other various messages to students. This project will be created as a web application as well as a mobile application.

## Features

* Separated by class, teachers will be able to post their office hour availability
* Office hour appointments will be set up in time blocks designated by the teacher
* Students will be able to view the office hours their teacher has available by class
* Students can choose a time block based on their availability, as long as the time block is not already scheduled for another Student
* When scheduling appointments, students will be able to leave an overview of what they would like to speak about so the teacher has the chance to prepare themselves beforehand if necessary
* Students will be able to communicate with teachers via messages
* Teachers will be able to post office hour cancellations on the public class page that the entire class will be able to view, or message the student to tell them about any cancellations or adjustments in their appointments
* The application will feature notifications that will alert the students when teachers have posted or sent them a message
